To **Alejandro Montanez Barrera** to further work on **[LR-QAOA quantum benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06471)**, which is a scalable volumetric benchmarking that allows the comparison of quantum process units (QPU) with different topologies. The aim is to integrate this benchmarking and the results into Metriq and expand the set of results to new QPUs.
