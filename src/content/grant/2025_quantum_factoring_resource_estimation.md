To **Yudong Cao, Shangjie Guo, Manuela Rivas Gómez, Aleyna Küçükçolak** for **quantum_factoring_resource_estimation** This project will focus on 1) generating an updated resource estimate for factoring incorporating some of the latest innovations in quantum arithmetic circuits, 2) demonstrating a modular way of implementing quantum algorithms with multiple underlying subroutines, and 3) demonstrating a way of visualizing and navigating different subroutines of quantum algorithms.
