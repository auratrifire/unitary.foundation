To **Fenton Clawson** to further develop **FLiMESolve**, short for Floquet-Lindblad Master Equation Solver, which was created for use in solving open quantum systems that fall under the regime of Floquet theory - namely those systems with periodic Hamiltonians. This tool is currently in the process of integration with QuTiP, an open source python package used to simulate a wide variety of hamiltonians.
