Quantum Computing devroom @ FOSDEM 2025
</SolidHeading>

## Call for Participation
 
We're excited to announce the return of the **Quantum Computing devroom** at FOSDEM 2025, scheduled for Sunday, February 2. 
After successful editions in 2019 and 2020, we’re ready to showcase all the innovative projects that have been built over the past four years and foster connections between quantum and classical open-source communities. Submit your proposals to help shape this year’s schedule—we look forward to seeing what you bring!

### About FOSDEM
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is a non-commercial event organized by the community, for the community. FOSDEM 2025 will take place on the weekend of February 1 and 2, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium. Participation is free and open to everyone. Attendance last year exceeded 8,000 participants.

## Essential Information
- Submission deadline: **December 1, 2024** (at 00:00 UTC+1)
- Announcement of selected talks: December 15, 2024
- Quantum Computing devroom: Sunday, February 2, 2025 (afternoon)
- Talk format: 25 minutes (including Q&A). In-person only.

## Topics of Interest
We'd like to make the devroom topics as diverse as possible, so we are looking to offer a mixture of presentations, short tutorials, demos, etc. Presentations must be related to open-source software for quantum technologies, but we do encourage submissions that push boundaries and experiment with the unexpected. We’d like to hear about new developments in:
- Quantum programming languages and tools
- Compilation, transpilation, and optimization of quantum programs
- Error mitigation, correction, and making noisy qubits work
- Software tools for open quantum hardware
- Quantum resource estimation and benchmarking
- Quantum cryptography, network, and communication

As well as more off the beaten track topics. Here are a few ideas:

- Quantum-inspired classical projects
- Lessons learned from building quantum software
- Insights on building open quantum communities
- Surprising and fun uses of quantum hardware or software
- Long-shot ideas and ambitious visions for the future of quantum software
- Mashups of quantum tech with art, games, or everyday tools
- New ways of teaching and learning quantum concepts

Or, of course, a superposition of the above! With the understanding that proposed talks should focus on substance over quantum hype.

If you have a wild idea that doesn’t fit into these categories, perfect—we love surprises! If it’s weird, bold, or thought-provoking, we want to hear about it. Please keep in mind that many attendees will not be quantum computing experts!

## Speaker Guidelines
- Please submit your talk proposals at https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/cfp
- FOSDEM is using a self-hosted Pretalx installation for managing talk submissions. You will need to create an account, if you don’t already have one.
- In the Submission notes, confirm that you will attend FOSDEM in person if your talk is accepted. We’re unable to fund travel or lodging for speakers, so make sure you have the means to attend.
- Select the «**Quantum Computing**» track for your proposal.
- All presentations will be recorded and shared under a Creative Commons license _(CC-BY-SA or CC-BY)_. By submitting, you agree to these terms.
