**After five years, the Quantum Computing devroom returns to FOSDEM.**

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a conference scheduled for 1-2 February 2025 at the ULB (Université libre de Bruxelles) Solboch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. It's a free event, and if you are in the area, you don't want to miss it! 

The Quantum Computing devroom is slotted for the second half of Sunday 2 February 2025. We will be in room [K.4.401](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/room/k4401/).

FOSDEM serves as a venue for open-source developers around the world to meet and facilitate conversations about the open-source ecosystem. This year, we hope to foster connections between the classical and quantum open-source ecosystems. Talks and presentations in each devroom (developer room) are suited to a particular topic of interest. In late 2024, we [put out a call](https://unitary.fund/community/FOSDEM_2025/) for the quantum devroom on talks related to: quantum software, quantum compilation, quantum programming languages, securing quantum communications, etc. 

The full schedule is available [here](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/quantum/). People with any or zero familiarity with quantum computing are welcome! If you are at FOSDEM for a "classical" track on Saturday and you are curious to know more about Quantum Computing, join our devroom on Sunday! After the event, recorded talks will be available at the same link.

Accepted talks will focus on:
- Implementing a programming language for an analog quantum computer
- Successes and struggles of quantum software engineering
- Translating quantum concepts to software solutions
- Utilizing quantum programming languages to resolve disparities between quantum abstractions and software development
- Securing communications through qubits
- Vendor-neutral Python library for quantum circuits and algorithms which can be transpiled to IBM’s Qiskit, Google Cirq, AWS Braket, or to extend the library to run on other hardware.
- Platform agnostic quantum open-source tools
- Open source library for constructing verifiable measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) patterns
- Cross-platform quantum compiler designed for frontend-agnostic, high-performance compilation of quantum circuits

We hope to see you in Brussels!
