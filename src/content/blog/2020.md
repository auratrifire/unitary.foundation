Unitary Foundation 2020 Annual Report
===============================

18 January, 2021  
  
To the Unitary Foundation community,

While 2020 was a challenging year in many ways, we're glad of the progress that we made helping the quantum tech ecosystem grow faster, better, and to the benefit of more people.  
  
As reviewed in our [2020 annual report](https://unitary.foundation/assets/Unitary_Fund_2020_Report.pdf), last year:  

*   We supported [20 more projects](https://unitary.foundation/grants.html) with microgrants, spanning from software to education and new community development.
*   We set up our [advisory board](https://unitary.foundation/posts/advisory_board.html) with 15 amazing volunteers that review and mentor our projects
*   We created Unitary Foundation’s [technical team](https://unitary.foundation/posts/unitary_labs_intro.html), hiring six top experts in open-source quantum software.
*   We built and released [Mitiq](https://unitary.foundation/mitiq.html), the world’s first error-mitigating quantum compiler. It is now integrated with most existing frameworks and already used for two research papers.
*   With QOSF, we launched the [Wittek Prize](https://qosf.org/wittek_prize/) for open source software
*   We launched our [discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation/) and [quantum software seminar](https://unitary.foundation/talks.html)
*   QuTiP became our first affiliated project, and we helped support it's new governance model

We’ve been impressed by the resilience of the quantum open-source community and the effectiveness of our operating model.  
  
**How can you help?** Help spread the word about Unitary Foundation and our microgrant program to new communities across the world. We could especially use help reaching out to communities that are typically underrepresented in quantum technology.  
  
We're always happy to receive feedback on our programs or to answer questions. Send an email to [contribute@unitary.foundation](mailto:contribute@unitary.foundation).  
  
Thanks to all of you for your commitment, excitement, and support.  
  
Looking forward to 2021!  
  
\-Will and the Unitary Foundation Team
