The ***2023 Quantum Open Source Software (QOSS) Survey*** is here! 

**[Update: Survey is now closed]**

This annual survey is a ***state of the community & industry snapshot***, from the bottom up. It is a chance for anyone who codes, or wants to code, for and with quantum technologies, to share their voice in the development of our field. The survey covers information on demographics, experience, community, research, tech stacks and more.

If you are a user or developer of software for any kind of quantum technology, we kindly encourage you to take this ~10 minute survey. Please note the survey will be available through October 27, 2023. Thank you for your help in building a better quantum computing ecosystem!

All anonymized results will be shared publicly later this year, so that the survey can be a resource for anyone who wants a better understanding of the quantum computing communityâ€™s needs. Unitary Fund will also analyze the data, report our filings and publish the aggregated results on our website. 

***A very large and heartfelt thank you*** to all the Unitary Fund community members, advisors, and partners who continue to help us provide this survey as a resource, including work in designing, testing and providing general feedback.
