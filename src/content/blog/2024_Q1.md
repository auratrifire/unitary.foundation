Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our 2024 Q1 quarterly update! We reached a huge milestone, surpassing 100 microgrants given to the community to support quantum open source projects. These microgrants have been awarded to people in 30 countries, resulting in 25+ papers, 40+ libraries, 100+ contributors and about 6k commits (excluding QuTip), 2 startups and 1 non-profit. A huge thank you to our members who make this work possible!

We awarded 7 new grants in Q1, including integration of Mitiq into OpenQAOA, building quantum programming content platforms, a quantum education initiative for girls in France and Venezuela, an entanglement toolbox for t-doped stabilizer states, and more! Additional details on each grant are available below.

We have also been hard at work preparing for our 4th edition of [unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/), an international virtual open-source hackathon where we give quantum projects cash to distribute to contributors by means of bounties. Last year, unitaryHACK had 700 participants and 72 hackers claimed 99 bounties, with more than $11k awarded. With over 30 registered projects and more to come, this year‚Äôs unitaryHACK is shaping up to be the largest one yet. If you would like to host an in-person meetup in your city to give your local community a space to gather, form teams, and work on unitaryHACK bounties, email <info@unitary.fund>. to let us know! And make sure to [register](https://unitaryhack.dev/register) to participate for your cash prize! 

This summer we will be hosting a Mitiq workshop as part of the summer school on Numerical Methods in Quantum Information Science, taking place in Boston. The school will cover best practices in software engineering, as well as the fundamentals of high-performance modeling techniques including state vector master equations, tensor networks, and the stabilizer formalism and its generalizations -- crucial tools in modeling quantum hardware and error correction. Multiple hackathons will be executed where instructors will be able to help you with your own research projects. To register for the school and to see more details, please go to [qnumerics.org](https://qnumerics.org/).

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum ecosystem!

## New From Unitary Fund

### Research
- Unitary Fund Staff contributed to the ‚ÄúReport for the ASCR Workshop on Basic Research Needs in Quantum Computing and Networking‚Äù, which is now published [online](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2001045).
- Vincent Russo and Andrea Mari from Unitary Fund and University of Camerino introduce in [[2402.04000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04000)] layerwise Richardson extrapolation, a new quantum error mitigation protocol generalizing zero-noise extrapolation, in which the noise of different individual layers (or larger chunks of the circuit) is amplified and the associated expectation values are linearly combined to estimate the zero-noise limit.
- The [review on open hardware in quantum technology](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apq/article/1/1/011501/3267254/Open-hardware-solutions-in-quantum-technology), co-authored by UF staff Nathan Shammah, Andrea Mari, Will Zeng, and many UF community members got published in the first issue APL Quantum, getting the journal cover! 
- Will Zeng co-authored with UF board member Travis L. Scholten and other co-authors a white paper ‚ÄúAssessing the Benefits and Risks of Quantum Computers‚Äù [[2401.16317](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16317)] reporting on the fact that ‚Äúthere is a credible expectation that quantum computers will be capable of performing computations which are economically-impactful before they will be capable of performing ones which are cryptographically-relevant‚Äù.  

### Metriq

Metriq has added a feature view on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) from the work of Joan √âtude Arrow (member of the QED-C Standards Committee) and her collaborators, collected with other VQA results.

Metriq launched an Open Quantum Benchmark Committee composed of a representative pool of experts in the field of quantum computing and quantum technology with domain expertise relevant to quantum benchmarks. More details to come soon!

### Mitiq 

New Releases: v0.34.0, v0.35.0

- [v0.35.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases): In this milestone, we've continued our work to support Qibo by providing a new tutorial, adding related Qibo-conversion functionality to the API-doc, and adding Qibo to our main list of supported frontends. We've also added the capability to use rotated randomized benchmarking circuits as part of the calibrator.
- [v0.34.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.34.0): Announcing support for [Qibo](https://qibo.science/), a newly integrated frontend in Mitiq! üì£

Qibo is an "end-to-end open source platform for quantum simulation, self-hosted quantum hardware control, calibration and characterization". Read more about this Mitiq release in [Francesc Sabater‚Äôs blog](https://unitary.fund/posts/adding_qibo/). 

### Aquapointer

We have completed another key milestone in our Q4Bio collaboration with Pasqal and Qubit Pharmaceuticals with new features added to our OSS package aquapointer. The new features are for processing density files representing the structures of protein cavities of interest. We also continue to refine the digital algorithm and resource estimates on benchmark protein hydration problems.

## Microgrant Updates:

**QuTiP:** The second QuTiP Developer Workshop was held at RIKEN, in Japan, March 24th-29th, 2024, bringing together over 25 contributors and project maintainers from all over the world. The project is lively, with updates on optimal control, GPU and HPC acceleration, QPU access and even a Julia package. During the workshop, QuTiP 5.0 was released, the first major release in 7 years!
 
**Toqito:** [toqito-v1.0.8](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/releases/tag/v1.0.8) was released earlier this year.

If you are a Python developer and are interested in contributing to the toqito project or a researcher who wishes to use toqtio in your workflow, feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito) or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1224467594661068923/1224474205081571398)!

**TQEC:** Development of the [Topological Quantum Error Correction (TQEC) circuit editor MVP](http://tqec.app/) is underway.

You can specify a 2D grid of qubits, and add plaquettes representing X and Z stabilizers to build a surface code. If you would like to contribute, checkout our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/QCHackers/tqec). 

**OpenQAOA:** Micrograntee winner Alejandro Monta√±ez-Barrera recently co-authored Transfer learning of optimal QAOA parameters in combinatorial optimization [[2402.0554](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05549)]. The paper discusses how evidence shows that fixed parameters give similar performance to exhaustive classical optimization search for MaxCut in QAOA. In this work, they extend this study and show the transfer learning (TL) capabilities of QAOA between different combinatorial optimization problems (COP) for up to 42 qubits. They experimentally evaluated these TL QAOA protocols on IonQ Harmony and Aria, IBM Brisbane, and Rigetti Aspen, finding that information can be recovered to some extent. They go a step further and demonstrate that TL is also possible between platforms, modifying the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealing schedule with that obtained in QAOA. They found an improvement in performance on instances of maximal independent set up to 170 qubits.

Alejandro Monta√±ez-Barrera created a demo tutorial on pennylane about [encoding combinatorial optimization problems](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_QUBO/). 

**Qlasskit**: The second stable release of [qlasskit](https://github.com/dakk/qlasskit) tagged as version [v0.1.17](https://github.com/dakk/qlasskit/releases/tag/v0.1.17). It includes:      

* Exporter for binary quadractic models (QUBO, BQM and ISING)
* Support for parameterizable qlassf functions.
* Exporters for Sympy, Qutip, Pennylane and qasm2            
* Quantum circuit experimental decompiler and optimizer      
* Bugfixing and performance improvements
