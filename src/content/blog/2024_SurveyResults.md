Unitary Fund is thrilled to be publishing the results of this year's Quantum Open Source Survey! Now in its third iteration, we hope this screenshot of our community, who we are, what tools we use, where our strengths lie, and how the field is changing, will provide illuminating and actionable insights as we look to develop a quantum ecosystem that is the most useful to the most people.  

Topics covered include Demographics, Experience, Cloud Services, Full-Stack Development Platforms, Compilers and Simulators, Software for Applications and Tools, User Experience, OSS Development and Research, and Community

Thank you to our open source community for their input, answers and participation! We continue to be amazed at the tools being developed all the time that push the science forward in ways both big and small. Thank you as well to our amazing donors, members and board, without which this would not be possible.
