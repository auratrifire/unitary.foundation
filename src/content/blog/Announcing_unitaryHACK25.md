We’re excited to announce the **5th annual edition of unitaryHACK!** The hackathon is set to take place **May 28th - June 11th, 2025**, and we hope you’ll join us. 

For those who are newer to the community, unitaryHACK is a unique bug-bounty style program that rewards **individuals at all experience levels**, building professional skills by substantively supporting our most important open source tools and contributing to a more functional, and featured, quantum computing stack.

**Last year, unitaryHACK had 1000+ participants, with 139 bounties claimed, and more than $13,000 awarded around the world.** You can read more about last year's unitaryHACK [here](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_q2/). 

Interested in participating in this year’s HACK? Here’s what you can do right now: 
- **Register** for unitaryHACK25 [through this link](https://airtable.com/apppeZIiaDZ7dgNya/pag7CoNawqpRfN6Oo/form)

- **Join** us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2Y9z9xKKbr) to be the first to hear announcements and ask our team any questions you may have leading up to the event
- **Consider** hosting an in-person hackday at your college or university as part of unitaryHACK. Ready to host? Reach out to Veena at **hack(at)unitary(dot)foundation** to set up your Hackday

See you all in two months!
