The Unitary Fund hackathon supporting quantum open source projects is happening now! [unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/) is a virtual event encouraging people to make contributions to the open source quantum ecosystem. The event will run **May 29-June 12, 2024**, and hackers have the opportunity to win cash bounties! unitaryHACK is unique to many quantum hackathon-style events for two big reasons:

- Hackers support existing quantum computing projects. 
- Hackers get paid for their work while building professional skills such as working on open source projects, and contributing to create a more functional, and featured, quantum computing stack.

unitaryHACK 2024 is the largest edition yet, hosting [**50 amazing open-source projects**](https://unitaryhack.dev/projects/): AI-inspired Classification of Quantum Computers, Amazon Braket Default Simulator, Amazon Braket SDK, AutoQASM, Azure Quantum Development Kit, bloqade-python, BQSKit, Braket.jl, BraketAHS.jl, BraketSimulator.jl, Cirq, Cirq Classiq Library, CUDA-Q, Fusion Blossom, graphix, HierarQcal, Ion(Q) Thruster, KQCircuits, lambeq, Metriq, Mitiq, OpenQAOA, OpenQASM 3 Parser, PennyLane, PennyLane Plugin for Amazon Braket, Perceval, Piccolo.jl, PyClifford, Qadence, qBraid-QIR, qBraid-SDK, Qiskit, Qiskit Aer, Qiskit Provider for Amazon Braket, qlasskit, Qrack, Quantum Machines QUA-to-Qiskit compiler and simulator, Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF), Quantum Universal Education, QuantumToolbox.jl, Qublitz, QuTiP Tutorials, rustworkx, scqubits, Tangelo
