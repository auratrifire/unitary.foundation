Dear Unitary Fund community,

We are excited to share our 2023 Q4 quarterly update! 

In November in Rome, Italy we wrapped up our first [unitaryCON](https://unitary.fund/posts/2024_looking-back-at-unitarycon/), an invitation-only collaborative workshop for the extended Unitary Fund community. The workshop was an opportunity to share ongoing projects, connect with collaborators and supporters, and work with our community to advance the quantum open-source software ecosystem with the leading contributors from around the world. A huge thank you to our core member Scientifica Venture Capital, whose collaboration and support via Quantum Italia made unitaryCON possible. 

In Q4 we also released the results of our second annual Quantum Open Source Survey to help the many diverse stakeholders of quantum technologies get a holistic understanding of the users, tools, needs and strengths of the ecosystem today. As it was the second survey, we were also excited to provide certain comparative metrics to view how things evolved since 2022. The purpose of this survey is to gather a dataset that is inclusive and representative of current and prospective open-source software coders, for and with quantum technologies in order to better serve users of the quantum computing ecosystem. Read the full details in our [blog](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_survey_results/) and explore the [survey results](https://unitaryfund.github.io/survey-website/) in depth.  

We awarded 4 new grants, ranging from a new library for financial assets, to a new project supporting and building open source hardware design, from a library implementing a genetic approach to quantum compilation, to a new Julia library for quantum optimal control. The full details of the grantees and projects can be found below. 

Scientific research using open source tools has continued in Q4, with two new papers uploaded to arXiv. Andrea Mari authored Counting collisions in random circuit sampling for benchmarking quantum computers, [2312.04222](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04222), whose core aspects are explained in this [blog post](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_collisions/). Vincent Russo co-authored Tight bounds for antidistinguishability and circulant sets of pure quantum states, [2311.17047](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17047).

Mitiq also had several important updates in Q4. Four new releases were made (v0.30-v0.33), with help from new contributors: Farzad Kianvash and Yash Prabhat. The documentation for the Quantum Subspace Expansion method is now live! Additionally, there are new benchmarking circuits (mitiq.benchmarks.generate_random_clifford_t_circuit) and new calibrator logging for easier discovery of performant quantum error mitigation techniques. Read more in the Mitiq section below!

Thank you all for your continued support of the open-source quantum ecosystem!

## New From Unitary Fund

#### Aquapointer
With support by Wellcome Leap, as part of the Quantum for Bio Program, we have completed a key milestone in our collaboration with Pasqal and Qubit Pharmaceuticals with the release of **aquapointer v0.0.1**! Aquapointer is an open source software package applying quantum algorithms to find locations of water molecules in a protein cavity.

v0.0.1 of aquapointer is available on [Github](https://github.com/unitaryfund/aquapointer) and on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aquapointer/). We encourage you to download and test out the package via PIP or download from GitHub. The repo includes a notebook directory with a demo notebook to help you get started.

Please send us your feedback via GitHub issues on the aquapointer repo (preferred) or via email at info@unitary.fund. 

#### Qrack
In Q4, Qrack launched an Ubuntu PPA (ppa:wrathfulspatula/vm6502q) with support for every standard architecture in (Canonical) Launchpad, for Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04 LTS versions. You can read more about simulating 54 qubits with Qrack ‚Äì on a single GPU, in this [blog post](https://unitary.fund/posts/qrack_report/) by Dan Strano.

#### Mitiq
New Releases: [v0.30.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.30.0), [v0.31.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.31.0), [v0.32.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.32.0), [v0.33.0](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases/tag/v0.33.0)

#### Updates from UF Microgrant Projects
We are excited about several new updates to microgrant projects. 

**Labscipt-qc**: The developers of  [labscipt-qc](https://github.com/fretchen/labscript-qc), a software framework for cold atom research groups to make their experiments more accessible, have published version 0.3.0 of the package [`sqooler`](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler). A [template](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/labscript-qc-example) for remote access should now make it possible for experimental research groups that control their systems with lab script to have fairly secure remote access. This new project, awarded a microgrant in Q3, would now greatly benefit from interested beta users.

**Quantify**: The recent updates to [Quantify](https://quantify-os.org/), a data acquisition framework for quantum computing and solid-state physics experiments, focus on improving quantum circuit design and experimentation. The software now supports more complex quantum circuits, including nested ones, and has significantly reduced compilation times by 30-75%. Users can save and reload complete experimental setups using JSON files, enhancing the ease of experiment replication.
Additionally, new operations such as the Gaussian pulse and complex-valued square pulse have been introduced. New schedules are available for two-qubit CZ tune-up and CPMG decoupling experiments, extending qubit coherence time. Finally, Quanitfy introduced a new debugging tool that allows the user to the export the entire experiment with detailed debug information.

**Qworld**: [Qworld](https://qworld.net/), a microgrant award winner from Q2 2023, has continued their work to bring quantum computing to a global audience. They hosted their first virtual class ["QClass23/24](https://qworld.net/qclass23-24/),‚Äù which started in September of 2023 with over 1000 students from all around the world. During the Autumn semester they offered (i) QCourse101-1: Fundamentals of Quantum Computing & Programming, (ii) Self-study module ‚ÄúQuantum Key Distribution‚Äù, and (iii) [QJam2024](https://qworld.net/qjam2024/) ‚ÄúMaking Quantum Games‚Äù. The Autumn semester will conclude at the end of January 2024. Additionally, Qworld conducted their first Quantum Software Development course with [Classiq "QCourse551-1"](https://go.classiq.io/simplify-quantum-circuit-design). 30 geographically diverse students completed 13 projects under the mentorship of Classiq researchers.

Two new QCousins joined the QWorld family: QUAE & QSouthAfrica.

**Qlasskit**: The first stable release v0.1.7 of the [qlasskit](https://github.com/dakk/qlasskit) library has been released on github and pypi. [Read more about qlasskit](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_qlasskit/).
