Traditionally, creating quantum circuits requires specialized knowledge in quantum programming. This requirement holds true when encoding a classical algorithm inside a quantum circuit, for instance, for an oracle or a black-box component of a quantum algorithm. This often becomes a time wasting job, since we almost always already have a classical implementation in a traditional high level language.

**Qlasskit**, an open-source Python library developed with the support of a Unitary Fund microgrant, addresses this challenge head-on by allowing direct translation of standard Python code into invertible quantum circuits without any modification to the original code. Furthermore, *qlasskit* implements some well-known quantum algorithms and offers a comprehensive interface for implementing new ones.

*Qlasskit* adopts a distinctive method where it constructs a *single boolean expression* for each output qubit of the entire function, rather than translating individual operations into quantum circuits and then combining them. This approach enables advanced optimization by leveraging boolean algebraic properties.

For instance, let assume we have the following function:

```python
from qlasskit import qlassf, Qint2, Qint4
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

@qlassf
def f_comp(b: bool, n: Qint2) -> Qint2:
      for i in range(3):
            n += (1 if b else 2)
      return n
```

The first things you can notice in this code are:

- the `qlassf` decorators, indicating that the function will be translated to a quantum circuit.
- special bit-sized types `Qint4`, and `Qint2`. These are required as qubits are a precious resource, and we want to use as few as possible.
- it all reads as normal Python code.

If we decompose the algorithm in 3 separate additions and we compile them separately, we obtain the following circuit:

```python
@qlassf
def f1(b: bool, n: Qint2) -> Qint2:
    return n + (1 if b else 2)

qc = QuantumCircuit(f_comp.num_qubits * 2 - 1)

for i in range(3):
    qc.append(f1.gate(), [0] + list(range(1 + i * 2, 5 + i * 2)))
```

While if we compile the whole function to a quantum circuit using *qlasskit*, we obtain the following quantum circuit:

As we can see from the circuit drawings, *qlasskit* approach needs half the number of qubits and half the number of gates.



## An use-case: pre-image attack on a cryptographic function

To further illustrate *qlasskit*'s capabilities, we will demonstrate its use in performing a pre-image attack on a cryptographic hash function using Grover's search algorithm, obtaining a quadratic speedup compared to classical approaches. The beauty of *qlasskit* lies in its simplicity â€“ you can write the entire software without needing to understand any concept of quantum computing.

A pre-image attack, in cryptography, targets a hash function `h(m)` with the aim to discover an original message `m` that corresponds to a specific hash value. On a traditional computer, to perform this attack without any hints, we must run `h(m)` with every possible input (`N=2**n`).

Thanks to the Grover search algorithm, we are able to find a pre-image with only `pi/2 * sqrt(N)` iterations, obtaining the quadratic speedup I mentioned before. 

We write a toy hash function `hash_simp` which operates on messages composed of two 4 bit values and uses bitwise xor to create an 8 bit hash value. 

```python
from qlasskit import qlassf, Qint4, Qint8, Qlist

@qlassf
def hash_simp(m: Qlist[Qint4, 2]) -> Qint8:
    hv = 0
    for i in m:
        hv = ((hv << 4) ^ (hv >> 1) ^ i) & 0xff

    return hv
```


To see the resulting quantum circuit we can export and draw in qiskit:

```python
hash_simp.export('qiskit').draw('mpl')
```

And this is the resulting circuit, produced by the *qlasskit* internal compiler:

Thanks to the fact that *qlasskit* functions are standard Python functions, we can call the `original_f` to perform some kind of analysis and test on the hash function. Since the input space is tiny (it is a toy hash function), we can check if the hash function is uniform (if it maps equally to the output space).

```python
from collections import Counter

d = Counter(hex(hash_simp.original_f((x, y))) for x in range(2**4) for y in range(2**4))

print('Hash function output space:', len(d))
```

We got that `hash_simp` is following an uniform distribution.

Now we use our quantum function as an oracle for a Grover search, in order to find which input maps to the value `0xca`.

```python
from qlasskit.algorithms import Grover

q_algo = Grover(hash_simp, Qint8(0xca))
```

Then we use our preferred framework and simulator for sampling the result; this is an example using `qiskit` with `aer_simulator`.

```python
from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

qc = q_algo.export('qiskit')
qc.measure_all()
simulator = Aer.get_backend("aer_simulator")
circ = transpile(qc, simulator)
result = simulator.run(circ).result()
counts = result.get_counts(circ)

counts_readable = q_algo.decode_counts(counts, discard_lower=5)
plot_histogram(counts_readable)
```

And this is the result of the simulation, where we can see that the pre-image that leads to `h(x) = 0xca` is the list `[12,12]`.

Using `QlassF.original_f` we can double check the result without invoking a quantum simulator; calling it with the list `[12,12]` must result in the hash value `0xca`.


```python
print(hex(hash_simp.original_f((12,12))))
```
