To **Katherine Van Kirk, Christian Kokail, Jonathan Kunjummen, Hong-Ye Hu, and Yanting Tengn** to further work on their **Derandomized Shallow Shadows** (DSS) algorithm, which outputs shallow measurement circuits for efficiently learning a large set of non-commuting observables. The team will develop an intuitive, open-source python package for DSS using tensor network techniques to ensure efficient runtimes and enable experimentalists to quickly identify low-depth circuits for Pauli learning.
