# Looking back at unitaryCON

![](/images/UnitaryCON.jpg)

Last November in Rome, Italy we wrapped up our first [unitaryCON](https://unitary.fund/community/unitaryCON/), an invitation-only collaborative workshop for the extended Unitary Fund community. The workshop was an opportunity to share ongoing projects, connect with collaborators and supporters, and work with our community to advance the quantum open-source software ecosystem with the leading contributors from around the world. A huge thank you to our core member [Scientifica Venture Capital](https://scientifica.vc/#/home), whose collaboration and support made unitaryCON possible. 

The unitaryCON program included talks from Oak Ridge National Lab, Amazon Braket, Qiskit, Xanadu, Pasqal, Perimeter Institute, Stellenbosch University and more. Many of the invited talk slides can be found [here](https://unitary.fund/community/unitaryCON/). Microgrant award winners spoke about their on-going project work and had a chance to hold more in-depth project office hours to meet to get feedback and ideas. Spencer Churchill, a Unitary Fund micrograntee, debuted the first printed version of [Quantum Tales](https://quantumtales.org/). Another micrograntee winner, Roger Luo, gave a great talk on the [Julia programming language in the quantum community](https://github.com/Roger-luo/talk/blob/main/2023/nov/unitarycon_2023_nov.pdf).

In addition to technical talks, the unitaryCON program included a panel discussion on the quantum ecosystem and feedback sessions for [Mitiq](https://unitary.fund/research/mitiq/) and [Metriq](https://unitary.fund/research/metriq/). Time was also dedicated to pitches, which was a lively and interactive session of free-flowing ideas to improve the open-course quantum computing ecosystem. 

Attendees had the chance to get an early preview of Unitary Fund’s [2023 Quantum Open Source Survey](https://unitary.fund/posts/2023_survey_results/) before the results were released publicly. This preview allowed for a robust discussion on the current state of the ecosystem, identifying gaps and areas for improvement as well as where the quantum computing ecosystem is excelling. 

On a scale of 1-10, participants gave unitaryCON an average rating of 9.3, finding the experience to be valuable and informative. The majority of participants found the interactions with other participants to be their favorite part of unitaryCON, in addition to helping them understand trends and roadmaps in open source quantum computing. Below are quotes from feedback received about the event:

> “These days were really inspiring to continue contributing to open source initiatives!”

> “I loved hearing about the different open source projects and ideas people have around abstracted quantum languages. I had a wonderful experience and wish we had more time to work together.”

> “I have a much clearer sense of the state of the quantum open source ecosystem as a whole, as well as near term developments and goals for the community.”

We can’t wait to see everyone again at the next unitaryCON! If you want to get involved or support our future events, please email info@unitary.fund.
