**After five years, the Quantum Computing devroom returns to FOSDEM.**

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a conference scheduled for 1-2 February 2025 at the ULB (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles) Solboch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. It's a free event, and if you are in the area, you don't want to miss it! 

The Quantum Computing devroom is slotted for the second half of Sunday 2 February 2025. We will be in room [K.4.401](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/room/k4401/).

The full schedule is available [here](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/quantum/). People with any or zero familiarity with quantum computing are welcome! If you are at FOSDEM for a "classical" track on Saturday and you are curious to know more about Quantum Computing, join our devroom on Sunday! After the event, recorded talks will be available at the same link.

We hope to see you in Brussels!
