As the quantum technology ecosystem grows, Unitary Fund’s mission becomes more and more important. I am excited to announce that we are growing our own support with two new additions to our board: [Anastasia Gamick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasiagamick/) and [Liz Durst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizdurst/).

Anastasia is Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer at Convergent Research, where she builds and incubates new kinds of transformative research institutions. I have a huge amount of respect for the work that she and Convergent are doing and for the ambition that they have. We are thrilled to have her expertise and support as we grow Unitary Fund. Unitary Fund is in many ways a unique institution in a new field and Anastasia is someone I turn to when we have a one-of-one challenge.

"I'm honored to join Unitary Fund's Board. With experience in nonprofit governance and operations, including scaling nonprofits for greater impact, I look forward to supporting Unitary Fund's mission of an equitable quantum future.” - Anastasia Gamick

Liz built and ran the IBM Quantum and Qiskit ecosystem to the huge open community success that they are today. That community and approach has had the kind of beneficial impact on quantum technology that we strive for at Unitary Fund. She has been a partner of our work at Unitary Fund for several years now and is a global leader in the open quantum ecosystem. We’re excited to learn from her and to have her support as we take our community and ecosystem to the next level.

“I’m excited to continue supporting the Unitary Fund in building the open quantum technology ecosystem. The next several years will be critical for driving better benchmarking transparency, stability, and performance standards as we learn from our diverse global community of quantum computing users.” - Liz Durst

We are glad to have their leadership and guidance as part of the Unitary Fund community as we continue to build a greater platform in open quantum technology. 

Liz and Anastasia join Unitary Fund's existing board members Christophe Jurczak, Travis Scholten and Nathan Shammah, to whom I am so grateful for their ongoing work and advocacy.
