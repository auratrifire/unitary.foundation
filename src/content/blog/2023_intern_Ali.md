## About Me
I am one of the 2023 Summer interns at Unitary Fund. I am a rising Senior at New York institute of Technology, studying Physics. Besides school, I am a research assistant with my professor, researching non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in squeezed environments.  I was introduced to quantum computing through Qubit by Qubit Early immersion program, and I hope to continue it. After all, I just spent my Summer working on it. 

## Internship
Getting into this, I didn't really know what to expect. First, I am working remote, second, I am way out of my field, and third, what is GitHub? Even though I had daunting questions (*and a near existential crisis*) I had truly a great team behind me, and to support me. Dan, Vincent, Ben, Misty, Nate, Will, Nathan, and literally everyone I spoke to, either offered me help, advice, or generally good tips. When we started, we were tasked with getting the [Metriq Client](https://github.com/unitaryfund/metriq-client) to run (*I highly recommend for anyone else to do this as well, such a satisfying feeling once it all starts to work*). Once that was completed, we focused on some [Metriq](https://metriq.info/) submissions, and worked on some issues for the client or the website. 

Then came the reveal of the new Unitary Fund [website](https://unitary.fund/) which looks superb (*I didn't do any of the aesthetics, but I am more than happy to take the credit*). We started to find and work on various issues and converted the HTML files to markdown. Srila (*the other intern - go read her blog post*) and I worked through those (*becoming pros at GitHub in the process*) and worked through the issues that we found. During the midst of all this, Nathan and Dan proposed for us to be a speaker on a [Quantum Wednesday](https://github.com/unitaryfund/quantum-wednesday) on the Unitary Fund Discord, so happily, we took on the challenge. Afterwards, we worked on the Metriq client, and tackled as many issues as we could. 

## Quantum Wednesday
Truth to be told, I was kind of hoping that my computer fried and I wouldn't have to do it. But I am so glad that I went through with it. Let me break down what Quantum Wednesday is. Find a research paper (*or topic*)  that is interesting enough to do a 45 minute talk about. Simple enough right? So naturally I did my presentation on 4 research papers. Due to the nature of the other work I mentioned, I had one week to present a mock presentation, and two weeks until the actual quantum Wednesday. I have never googled so many terms in my life. These papers could've been written in another language the way I barely understood it the first, the second or the third time reading it. It was difficult, I said I was *introduced* to quantum computing, not that I was an *expert* in it. I spent roughly 25 hours reading, researching, and putting up my mock presentation in a week.

When the mock presentation day came, I can confidently say that it was the worst presentation of my life. I'll spare you the details, but it could be severely improved. On top of that, a final paper came out in relation to the other 4, and of course, I naturally took that on. With one week to present all 5 papers, I gave it my all, trying to correct my errors, reading the last paper, and trying to make a good presentation. When the actual day came, I can confidently say that it was good, actually really good. It roughly took me 25 minutes to present it all in a clear and concise way, and I spent the next 20 minutes professionally answering questions. Ultimately, I am so happy that I did it (*a learning curve indeed, but a challenge I am happy that I took*). You can find the necessary papers and slides [here!](https://github.com/unitaryfund/quantum-wednesday)

Regardless of the time, effort, sweat and everything in between, this is truly the gem of my time at Unitary Fund. 

## Closing Note
Unitary Fund is an open source quantum technology system that works to benefits the most people, and a place that I will cherish (*and brag about*) forever. I am genuinely, and sincerely happy I was able to have my internship here. The team is filled with such amazing people (*They are truly the building blocks of Unitary Fund*) that I had the utmost pleasure of working with. Working here was nothing short of a great learning experience, promoting me to be a better worker, researcher, and of course, better learner. Thank you Unitary Fund!
