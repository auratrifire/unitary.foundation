**After five years, the Quantum Computing devroom returns to FOSDEM.**

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) is a conference scheduled for 1-2 February 2025 at the ULB (Université libre de Bruxelles) Solboch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. The Quantum Computing devroom is slated for the second half of 2 February 2025.

FOSDEM serves as a venue for open-source developers around the world to meet and facilitate conversations about the open-source ecosystem. This year, we hope to foster connections between the classical and quantum open-source ecosystems. Talks and presentations in each devroom (developer room) are suited to a particular topic of interest. In late 2024 we put out a call for the quantum devroom on projects related to: quantum software, quantum compilation, quantum programming languages, securing quantum communications, etc. People with any or zero familiarity with quantum computing are welcome!

The full schedule is available [here](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/quantum/). After the event, recorded talks will be available at the same link.

Accepted talks will focus on:
- Implementing a programming language for an analog quantum computer
- Successes and struggles of quantum software engineering
- Translating quantum concepts to software solutions
- Utilizing quantum programming languages to resolve disparities between quantum abstractions and software development
- Securing communications through qubits
- Vendor-neutral Python library for quantum circuits and algorithms which can be transpiled to IBM’s Qiskit, Google Cirq, AWS Braket, or to extend the library to run on other hardware.
- Platform agnostic quantum open-source tools
- Open source library for constructing verifiable measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) patterns
- Cross-platform quantum compiler designed for frontend-agnostic, high-performance compilation of quantum circuits

We hope to see you in Brussels!
