Dear Unitary Foundation community,

Over the past few months there have been some exciting updates in the UF community! We’re now Unitary Foundation, to better reflect the breadth of our work across the open source quantum community; we recently brought 3 new team members on board; and, in case you missed it, we [published the results](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_surveyresults/) of the most recent QOSS Survey. Check out more below for updates from micrograntees, new open source research, as well as Mitiq, Metriq, and much more.


## New from Unitary Foundation

**2025 Microgrant Advisory Committee Announced** 
Late last year we announced our [2025 Advisory Committee](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_advisory_board_2025/) (with [two more members](https://unitary.foundation/posts/welcome_jamie_ying/) joining early this year). Each year, UF’s advisory committee, composed of dedicated experts from across the quantum technology community, works hand-in-hand with our staff to administer our microgrants. Thank you to our committee for joining us and supporting our mission - we’re excited to be working with you this year! 

**Welcome to the new UF staff members!** 
At the beginning of this year, we added three new staff members. [Changhao Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/changhao-li-698ba8122/) and [Brad Chase](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bachase/) joined the technical team, while [Veena Vijayakumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veenavijayakumar/) joined the operations team.

## Other News from the Community
- IBM held their [Quantum Developer Conference (QDC)](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qdc-2024), and made materials from the event available via the [IBM Quantum learning platform](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/qdc2024). 
- The Quantify community produced a 0.0.1 version of a backend for LabOne Q and Zurich Instruments. This was done within the framework of the European OpenSuperQPlus project. [More info can be found on the OrangeQS blog](https://orangeqs.com/news/quantify-zurich-instruments-0-0-1-release/).
- GQuantum Education began outreach to Senior high school, and were fortunate to join WiStem-Gh in their camp. In addition, they launched their e-learning African International School on Quantum Science and Technology for 2025. 
- Micrograntee Andi Gu’s project “An entanglement toolbox for t-doped stabilizer states beyond the classical simulability barrier” was [recently published in APS](https://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.062427) and the code is open sourced [here](https://github.com/andigu/tdoped).
