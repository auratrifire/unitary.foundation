title: Member of Technical Staff - Full-Stack Web Developer (UI/UX), Full-Time, Remote
---
Posted on April 24th, 2025. 

Full-time role.

Unitary Foundation is a non-profit research group helping build a quantum technology industry that benefits the most people. We support the community, e.g., running a grant program to support the development of new open source quantum software, and we do our own research and technology development for the ecosystem.

Through this role, you’ll be at the center of the emerging field of quantum technology and working to develop new and critical components to accelerate it.

## Role Details  - Member of the Technical Staff, Full-Stack Web Developer (UI/UX), 

We’re hiring a Member of Technical Staff to join the Unitary Foundation and own our web development projects, including our web platform for quantum benchmarks, and the one for quantum hackathons.

As a Full-Stack Web Developer (UI/UX), you will join a team developing software and performing research as part of sponsored research projects led by Unitary Foundation, in collaboration with key players from the industry and research sector.

The initial focus of this role will be on the *Quantum Benchmarking data visualization platform*. We are building an open-source framework to benchmark quantum computers across different platforms ([metriq-gym](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/metriq-gym)), and we are at a point where we want to share the results produced by this framework on a public website. For this purpose, we are refurbishing Metriq (https://metriq.info), which is a web platform we have maintained in the past few years for crowdsourcing benchmark results from papers. You will be building and owning the infrastructure that our researchers will use to publish curated web pages around data coming from the new benchmarking framework.

Your work will also include other projects that would benefit from UX/UI improvements and data visualization for the whole Unitary Foundation online assets, such as the [unitaryHACK](https://unitaryhack.dev/) website, and the Quantum Open Source Survey [results](https://unitaryfoundation.github.io/survey-2024/).

## RESPONSIBILITIES

### Product Ownership
You will independently shape the products, manage tasks and coordinate with colleagues to identify priorities as well as troubleshoot issues. You will be responsible for the entire software development lifecycle, from design to deployment and maintenance. You will be assisted by the rest of the staff and the research team on the technical details, but you will be the main point of contact for the development of the web platforms.

### Detail-oriented development
The ideal candidate will have an analytical mind and attention to details. The benchmarking project requires an especially high degree of rigor, as inaccuracies can lead to misleading conclusions and erode trust – especially when results are perceived as misrepresenting a vendor's performance.

### Community Growth
Engaging with users, identifying key personas, and building tools for the community that people genuinely want to use.

## SKILLS & QUALIFICATIONS
We will expect you to have 3+ years of professional experience relevant to:
- Web development experience, frontend – React.js, Angular, or similar single-page application (SPA) framework, modern JavaScript experience
- Web development experience, backend – Node.js, Postgres, SQL, but we also use Python extensively in many of our projects.
- Experience with data insights and data visualization – D3.js, Chart.js, or similar
- Track record of building and launching software that other people use with small teams
- Excited to make quantum technologies better, easier, and more accessible
- Experience with software development tools for teams like GitHub, and with DevOps practices.

## Preferred Qualifications: 
- 2+ years of research experience in quantum information, such as in a master or PhD program
- Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure
- Experience in quantum computing, other advanced technology communities, and/or open source software development
- Being an active member of the Unitary Foundation community
- Experience with cloud collaboration services and open-source community tools such as Airtable, Discord, Mailchimp
- Experience in machine learning (ML), specifically ML engineering with large language models (LLM) for classification

## WORK HOURS & BENEFITS
**Flexible Hours** - We are happy to accommodate complex schedules or limitations, and care more about the work getting done than the times you’re sitting at your computer.

**Alignment** - Being a small team, we will be seeking a collaborator who aligns with our culture, and we would love for it to be a delight to work together.
