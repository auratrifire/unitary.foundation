**After five years, the Quantum Computing devroom returns to FOSDEM.**

FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) the largest gathering about open source software in Europe and will take place on the weekend of 1-2 February 2025 at the ULB (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles) Solboch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. It's a free-to-attend event, and if you are in the area, you don't want to miss it! 

For the first time since 2020, FOSDEM will feature a Quantum Computing devroom, which is slotted for the second half of Sunday 2 February 2025. We will be in room [K.4.401](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/room/k4401/).

The full schedule for the Quantum Computing devroom is available [here](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/quantum/). Whether you're completely new to quantum computing or already familiar with it, everyone is welcome! If you're attending a "classical" track at FOSDEM on Saturday and are curious to explore Quantum Computing, be sure to visit our devroom on Sunday. After the event, recorded talks will be available at the same link.

We hope to see you in Brussels!
