Over the past few years the development and progressive availability of quantum computing devices on the cloud has enabled the scientific community with access to testing practical algorithm compilation. New techniques have been invented against coherence-destructing noise of quantum systems, such as in Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM). After a first body of theoretical and experimental results has been obtained on the ground, it seems of utmost importance to organize a workshop to review results, share best practices, identify dead ends, and work towards new prospects.
 
## About the workshop

The Workshop on Error Resilience in Quantum computing ([WERQSHOP](https://werq.shop/)) will take place June 17-19 at New York University in New York City and will bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners working on all aspects of QEM and error resilient compilation — from sample complexity to the implementation of protocols in real-world quantum computing pipelines.

The goal is to foster collaboration between:
- Software developers building open source QEM tooling and integrations,
- Researchers exploring the feasibility and limitations of QEM,
- Practitioners applying QEM to improve near-term quantum hardware,
- Compiler developers working to enable seamless QEM integration.

By convening this diverse group, we aim to generate focused ideas on what to research and what to build next in QEM, especially in the context of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (eFTQC).

This is the second workshop organized by the Mitiq team. The [first event](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_recap_mitiq_workshop/) was held in 2024 as part of the [QNumerics Summer School](https://qnumerics.org/2024/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst – Mt. Ida Campus, where we introduced Mitiq in the broader context of quantum computing and numerics.

Unlike that first event, this workshop is focused specifically on quantum error mitigation and resilience techniques, and is not limited to Mitiq.

## Important Dates

## About Mitiq

[Mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers. It is compatible with most quantum frontends such as Qiskit, Cirq, OpenQASM, PyQuil, Braket and is backend agnostic. It is a collection of quantum error mitigation techniques that can be applied at the gate level.  Mitiq allows users to apply advanced QEM techniques for low-level compilation and extrapolation such as zero noise extrapolation, probabilistic error cancellation, virtual distillation, and error suppression via dynamical decoupling.

It has been developed by Unitary Foundation and a global community over the past six years. Its [impact and future](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2024_mitiq_impact/) include over 200,000 downloads from the PyPI server and more than 80 contributors for over 44 releases. The Mitiq whitepaper has over 120 citations. Mitiq is used at research institutions worldwide including IBM research, Harvard, University of Madrid, PASQAL, Cisco, Saarland University, and many more. 

## About related Unitary Foundation research and development

Unitary Foundation has performed research to develop QEM techniques and a software infrastructure, testing it on quantum hardware over the years. It includes tens of presentations at international conferences and research centers and over 15 publications in peer-reviewed research journals. A list of publications can be found [here](https://unitary.foundation/research/publications/). Further research and development and open-source infrastructure building for noise resilient compilation is performed within the [recently introduced](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2025_ucc_launch_blog/) unitary compiler collection (UCC). 

## Funding and acknowledgements

WERQSHOP is made possible by funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), under a [POSE Phase II grant](https://unitary.foundation/posts/2023_mitiq_nsf_pose/) for the development of an open source ecosystem for Mitiq. Additional funding for Mitiq, quantum error mitigation research by Unitary Foundation and development of next generation compilers and quantum benchmarks has been provided by IBM Research, the US Department of Energy ARQC TEAM program and ASCR SMART Stack program. Unitary Foundation acknowledges additional support from its Members.

Last but not least, this workshop is made possible thanks to a number of volunteers co-organizing it, a complete list can be found on the [WERQSHOP](https://werq.shop/) website.
