### *Thursday, September 12, 2024*

**Speakers:** Ben Castanon and Nathan Shammah, Unitary Fund  
**Title:** [An overview of Unitary Fund and recent focus areas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_sD0BNb9DFu4k7jGkLVNzno5bpViAoCaX_HPj9Qurs4/edit?usp=sharing)
**Abstract:** Unitary Fund is a non-profit focused on cultivating a quantum ecosystem that can help the most people. We do this through grantmaking, community building support, and original research and development of public goods within quantum technology. We cover the latest advancements in our microgrants, programs and community resources, as well as the organization's research priorities and updates including benchmarking, resource estimation, compilation, error mitigation, and open hardware.

**Speaker:** Dan Strano, Unitary Fund  
**Title:** Metriq: a web platform and community for quantum technology benchmarks  
**Abstract:** Metriq: a web platform and community for quantum technology benchmarks  
There is little or no consensus on what constitutes a representative and useful benchmark for quantum computers at the current “noisy intermediate-scale quantum” (NISQ) era of hardware research and development. Literature on quantum benchmarks exists in disparate journals and repositories, comparison between published ad hoc benchmark metrics is difficult, and there is no central community hub to vet and discuss published results. Despite this, many hardware providers developing prototypes are already attempting to pivot to commercialization of NISQ devices.

The Metriq platform (https://metriq.info) aims to be a community hub and repository for review of the capabilities of quantum computers in general public use and in peer-reviewed literature. Metriq fits open-ended community-contributed research literature results to a simple standardized schema that enables automatic comparison and graphing of quantum technologies across the field on common “tasks,” comparing “methods” operating on “platforms,” achieving “results” that can be fairly compared over time. Through Unitary Fund’s online community-building initiative, Metriq draws together researchers, professionals, and enthusiasts to build a Wiki-like library of published and independent quantum benchmarks.

**Speaker:** Mathias Weiden, BQSKit  
**Title:** Compiling Resource-Efficient Quantum Programs with BQSKit  
**Abstract:** Quantum hardware is experiencing a boon leading to more chip variety, configurations with higher fidelities, and demonstrations of quantum error correction below fault-tolerance thresholds. While ultimately, this will translate to a boon for the entire field of quantum computing, it presents two problems. First, algorithm designers and users must make more difficult choices between potential hardware vendors. Second, this places more of the overall burden of end-to-end quantum applications on the software stacks, specifically the quantum compiler. The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) is a powerful and portable compiler with a proven ability to alleviate these issues and translate recent hardware successes up to the algorithm level. In this talk, I will first introduce the idea of numerical instantiation, a core primitive of BQSKit compilation. Next I will highlight several advancements and applications of synthesis including permutation aware synthesis, QFactor instantiation, seeded synthesis, principled circuit approximation, application motivated gate set evaluation, and synthesis for fault-tolerant gate sets.

**Speaker:** Max Aalto, OpenQuantum  
**Title:** OpenQuantum: open-source hardware for ultracold atoms  
**Abstract:** OpenQuantum is a complete, simple, low-cost, and open-source blueprint for a rubidium magneto-optical trap. The initiative provides high-quality educational materials alongside CAD models, electronics schematics, control firmware, and assembly instructions, to substantially lower the barrier to entry for building a teaching lab for quantum engineering. Our goal is to accelerate the growth of the fields of atomic physics and quantum information by spreading tacit knowledge, providing robust solutions to common problems, and developing scalable manufacturing for high supply chain risk components.

**Speaker:** Stefano Carrazza, Qibo  
**Title:** Qibo: an open-source hybrid quantum operating system  
**Abstract:** The growing interest in quantum computing and the recent progress of quantum hardware devices motivates the development of new advanced computational tools focused on performance and usage simplicity. Therefore, in this talk, we present Qibo, an open-source quantum computing middleware framework which provides to users a standardized set of tools for the design, simulation and execution of quantum circuits on classical and quantum hardware [1]. We describe the major backend libraries integrated in Qibo for quantum simulation [2], quantum hardware control and calibration [3]. We show benchmark results related to the simulation and control performance of Qibo and provide examples of full-stack quantum computing algorithms developed in the context of particle physics applications [4]. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the new features planned for the next major release and by providing an overview of Qibo's integration into national quantum research initiatives around the world.

*Lightning Talks:*	
- **Speaker:** Viet Nguyen, GA-QAS
**Abstract:** This talk presents the method and results of GA-QAS for multi-target quantum
compilation applications, which has important implications for variational methods on
emulating quantum evolution under varying physical parameters such as time,
temperatures, atomic distances, etc. Generally, the GA-QAS purposefully searches for an
efficient quantum circuit to simulate multiple target states created by the variation in the
Hamiltonian's physical parameters. Our benchmarks and case studies demonstrate the
algorithm's effectiveness and flexibility in a wide range of problems, including but not
limited to thermal state preparation (TSP), time-dependent quantum dynamic simulation
(TD-QDS), and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

- **Speaker:** Alejandro Montañez-Barrera, OpenQAOA  
**Title:** Combinatorial optimization problems in the OpenQAOA library  
**Abstract:** Solving combinatorial optimization problems (COP) using quantum computation usually requires encoding them into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. In this talk, I will present results on the set of COPs included in the OpenQAOA library as part of the microgrant project "Optimization problems in OpenQAOA".

**Speaker:** Tyson Jones  
**Title:** The QuEST to desperately maintain the relevance of statevector simulations  
**Abstract:** There are many algorithms and paradigms to classically simulate quantum computers. The full-state method numerically instantiates the quantum state as dense vectors and matrices. This teeny-brain method prescribes upfront exponentially growing memory and runtime costs. But computational complexity isn't everything - in the right settings, full-state simulation may actually be galactic-brain. This talk will desperately attempt to motivate the continued relevance of full-state simulators in order to showcase QuEST, a highly-parallel simulator of statevectors and density matrices.

**Speaker:** Spencer Churchill  
**Title:** [Adversarial Circuit Benchmarking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gi2u0g4RmIfoYZl0skSmy-fTd42VCROos3uVphpu4Cg/view)
